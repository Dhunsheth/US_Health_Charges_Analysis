## US Health Charges Analysis
This project was done to model individuals health insurance charges in the United States based on some demographic information (BMI, Region, Smoker, Children, Sex, and Age). The data was fit using the following models: Linear Model, Lasso, Tree, Random Forest, and a Boosted approach. The cross-validated MSE estimates were compared, however, the primary decision was based on the test MSE results, for which the Boosted model performed the best.
